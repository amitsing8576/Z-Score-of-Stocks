##Z-Score Statistics of Stocks
#Overview
This project involves building a model to generate Z-Score statistics for five stocks from different Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors over a period of six months. The project utilizes various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

#Features
Data Download: Uses yfinance to download historical stock prices.
Data Analysis: Utilizes Numpy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and calculation of Z-Scores.
Data Visualization: Employs Matplotlib to create visual representations of the stock data and Z-Scores.

#Importance
Risk Assessment: Z-Scores help in identifying how far a stock's price is from its mean in terms of standard deviations, providing insight into its volatility and risk.
Comparative Analysis: By analyzing stocks from different GICS sectors, investors can compare their performance and volatility, aiding in diversification strategies.
Informed Decision-Making: The visualizations generated in this project make it easier for investors to interpret the data and make informed investment decisions.

#Installation
